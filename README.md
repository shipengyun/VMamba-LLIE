> **Abstract:** Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task due to the loss of detail and color distortion under insufficient illumination. This paper introduces VMamba-LLIE, a novel triple-branch network that leverages SNR prior guidance and HVI color space assistance for superior low-light image enhancement. The proposed model integrates a global modeling branch for long-range dependency analysis, a local modeling branch for fine-grained detail recovery, and a color assistance branch for high-quality color reconstruction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that VMamba-LLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a smaller model size, outperforming existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness.
